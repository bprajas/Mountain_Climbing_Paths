How to Climb a Mountain Mathematically

Overview:

This is a simple Python project that compares three paths for climbing a mountain:

A straight-line (parametric) path.

A geodesic path using the Euler–Lagrange equation.

A time-optimised path using Tobler’s hiking function.

It visualises all three over a synthetic 3D mountain surface and compares their length, slope, and estimated time.

What’s Here:

Python code to compute and plot:

The three paths

Their arc lengths and slopes

A comparison chart

How to Run:

Clone this repo

Install required libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, scipy)

Run the main script (e.g., paths_plot.py)

Files:

paths_plot.py – Main script that creates the surface and draws the three paths
